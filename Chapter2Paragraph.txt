The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was unusually active, with tropical cyclone activity both before June and after November for the first time in 50 years. There were three major hurricanes, and the sixteen named storms tied for the sixth highest total on record. The strongest hurricane of the season was Isabel, which reached Category 5 on the Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale northeast of the Lesser Antilles, and later struck North Carolina at Category 2, causing damage worth $3.6 billion and 51 deaths across the Mid-Atlantic United States.

The minimal hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico, respectively. (Full article...)
